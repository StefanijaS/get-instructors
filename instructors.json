                "I started off as a PT back in 2011. It quickly came apparent to me that I enjoyed the puzzle of how to help people live longer, feel more confident and develop movement skills that would translate to everything else they did in life. I believe that there is still a big aspect for most people about wanting to look a certain way and CrossFit opened my eyes to a newer perspective of “Nice body, what can you do with it?”. I believe that when people develop better movement patterns, stronger foundations and an open mindset that they can not only achieve their goals but surpass them. Watching people surpass what they thought they were capable of and set themselves on a new path to greater health is the primary reason I coach."

You’re the one that has to walk through it.” - I’m big on helping guide people but empowering them so that they don’t need me holding their hand the whole way. Education around fitness is huge for me and something I’m very passionate about."

Helping them get stronger and move well gives them the freedom to step out of that paradigm of ``pressure to look good`` and focus more on the process of movement and in term getting stronger. From that confidence in themselves builds and inevitably they end up looking better as a result of being stronger."

The physiological changes are one thing - we're all up for looking better naked, but the psychological changes that you get from constant struggle, sacrifice, reward and reflection are a lesson that can be applied to all areas of our life. It's a privilege to see these changes in people on a daily basis, and see the changes filter through to their lives and the lives around them."
